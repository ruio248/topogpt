## Introduction
**topogpt** is a project focused on building a domain-specific large model for the field of topological materials. Compared to other fields like law or healthcare, the domain of topological materials is much more complex, filled with intricate concepts. Therefore, building a domain-specific large model can better serve this field. 

The research questions we aim to address include:

  - **How to acquire domain-specific knowledge and systematically transform it into high-quality training datasets suitable for large language models.**

  - **How to design and implement an objective, rigorous, and unbiased automated evaluation framework to assess the quality and performance of outputs generated by large language models.**

  - **How to develop more effective and efficient training methodologies to enhance the scalability and optimization of large language model training processes.**

  - **How to leverage large language models to assist domain experts and researchers in solving complex scientific problems, thereby extending their capabilities beyond conventional knowledge-based question-and-answer tasks.**

## Code Overview
- **Train**:  
  The training code for the model is contained in this section, providing the framework for pretraining and fine-tuning the model using topological materials data.

## Installation
  - **Requirements**:  
    The project requires Python 3.8 or higher, as well as the necessary libraries such as PyTorch, Transformers, and other dependencies.

## Usage
- **Pretraining**:  
  To pretrain the model, run the `pretrain.py` script with the appropriate command-line arguments.

- **Fine-tuning**:

## To Do
- Currently, V1 of the project only includes part of the code. The complete source code will be released after the paper is finalized.
