## Introduction
This repository is part of an ongoing project aimed at harnessing the power of large prediction models for scientific research. The focus is particularly on integrating these models into a framework that assists researchers by automating complex tasks such as crystal generation. The tools in this repository operate based on the REACT (Reason, Explain, Act, Console, and Test) paradigm, ensuring structured and replicable interactions with the models.

## Directory Structure
- `tool`
  - `agent.py`: Core script that interfaces with the prediction models.
  - `react_template.py`: Template script that defines the structured REACT paradigm for tool interactions.
  - `tool.py`: Script containing implementations of the laboratory-developed crystal generation models and other tools.


## Current Availability
At present, the repository publicizes only the most fundamental tool invocation process. This ensures that users can start exploring the basic functionalities, providing a solid foundation that will be expanded upon with future developments.

## Future Developments
The comprehensive workflow, encompassing all facets of interaction with large prediction models, will be detailed upon the completion of our ongoing research paper. As we further develop our systems and publish our findings, more sophisticated features and functionalities will be disclosed. These advancements will include more advanced integrations and possibly interactive features that cater specifically to the needs of the research community.
