        "text": "The quantum amplitude of the closed trajectory corresponds to the sum of the of amplitudes when the self-intersecting path is taken in opposite directions; i.e., \\(|(e^{i\\phi_{1}}+e^{i\\phi_{2}})/\\sqrt{2}|^{2}=1+\\cos(\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2})\\), where \\(\\phi_{1}\\) and \\(\\phi_{2}\\) correspond to the Berry phase passing over the closed loop in opposite directions.\n\nAs can be seen in Fig.\n\n4, \\((\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2})\\) corresponds to the phase associated with rotation of \\(\\theta_{p}\\) by \\(2\\pi\\).The corresponding Berry phase could be calculated \\[\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}=\\int_{\\theta_{0}}^{\\theta_{0}+2\\pi}dt\\langle\\Psi(\\mathbf{p} _{\\mathbf{p}})|\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|\\Psi(\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathbf{p}}) \\rangle=+\\frac{p^{2}}{p^{+}+\\Delta_{f}^{2}}\\pi=\\] for \\(\\Psi=|a\\rangle\\) or \\(|b\\rangle\\).\n\nThe two limits \\(p\\to 0\\) (\\(\\Delta\\phi\\to 0\\)) and \\(p\\gg\\Delta_{f}/V_{D}\\) (\\(\\Delta\\phi\\to\\pm\\pi\\)) lead to localization and antilocalization behavior, respectively.With increasing the chemical potential, localization behavior changes into antilocalization, which is expected for a single TI surface.\n\nComparing Fig.\n\n5 with the Seebeck results in Fig.\n\n1, we see that, in some range of chemical potential where the films have high thermoelectric performance, the antilocalization effect is also present.\n\nThis leads to another advantage of the TI thin films The quantum corrections increase the conductivity.We found that simply creating a nanometer-scale thin film of Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) generates a hybridization-induced band gap of the unconventional surface states that can be tuned by film thickness.\n\nThis is indeed an essential feature for controlling the figure of merit in a material which is already thermoelectric in the bulk.\n\nCombined with some residual robustness against impurity scattering, this leads to an increased low-temperature \\(zT\\) of the film.The same technique can equally well be applied to Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) or alloys in this class.\n\nWhile we have concentrated on the specific case of a thin film (or single superlattice layer) in this Letter, the topological surface state of these materials is an important physical feature that will also affect thermoelectric transport in other nanoscale geometries.\n\nThe authors acknowledge conversations with K. Hippalgaonkar and R. Ramesh and support from BES DMSE (P. G. and J. E. M.).",
