        "answer_2": "Here are some instruction questions generated based on the text:\n\n1. What kind of crystals exhibit non-trivial insulating behavior without applying any external force?\n2. Which element combinations are calculated to demonstrate difficulty achieving three-dimensional Topological Insulator (TI) properties due to weak spin-orbit coupling?\n3. Based on studies by scientists, what percentage of strain was applied to examine if (\\(M_3N\\))Sb exhibits band inversion?\n4. Are the oxides mentioned in the text part of the antiperovskite material class?\n5. In relation to a specific compound (\\(M_3O\\))Pb, under what conditions does it appear as a potential 3D TI material?\n6. How many electrons possess each ion (\\(ME^{\\}}_(E=\\text{Si}, Ge, Sn, Pb), E)^$ in the aforementioned family of antiperovskite compounds? \n7 Does the spin-orbit coupling cause an upward movement or downward shift in the electronic energy levels within the valence bands across different compounds investigated?\n\n9. What significant role does the crystal's symmetry play regarding previously discovered 3D TIs' lattices?\n10. Has the discovery led to any novel findings on Topological Insulators or their structural classifications?\n11. The materials listed as examples of existing TIs have certain specific phase geometries; may they further clarify the classification, using only hexagonal, cubic?",
