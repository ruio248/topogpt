Why is it crucial to consider quantum corrections induced by higher-order hopping terms for a comprehensive understanding of Sr2CuO2Cl2's ground-state properties?\n6. By how much was the ordered moment of Sr2CuO2Cl2 observed to decrease compared to predictions from simpler models?\n7. How do the results presented here contribute to our broader understanding of cuprate materials' phase diagrams?\n8. Which institution collaborated on building the SAXES instrument used in this study?\n9. What would be beneficial about adapting the approach demonstrated in this work for studying other complex systems like the cuprates?\n10.
