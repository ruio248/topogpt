        "text": "Consider TlBiTe\\({}_{2}\\) as an example.\n\nThe gap at \\(\\Gamma\\) decreases rapidly as the slab thickness increases, indicating that a gapless Dirac band exists at \\(\\Gamma\\) on the surface in the infinite thickness limit.\n\nNote, however, that the existence of a surface Dirac band at \\(\\Gamma\\) by itself does not reveal the band topology, and the surface spectrum near the \\(\\tilde{M}\\) points must also be considered.\n\nHence a \\(k\\cdot p\\) model around \\(\\Gamma\\) is not adequate for these compounds.In our slab calculations, surface states near \\(\\tilde{M}\\) have strong finite size effects arising from interactions between the two end surfaces of the slab.\n\nThis sensitivity to finite size effects could be utilized to design thin film samples which have quantum spin Hall states.\n\nIn these films, the Dirac points are all gapped, as in Fig.\n\n4, and we can calculate the 2D topological index \\(Z_{2}\\) by analyzing only the points \\(\\tilde{\\Gamma}\\) and \\(\\tilde{M}\\).From wave function parity analysis at these points, illustrated in Fig.\n\n4, we obtain \\(Z_{2}=-1\\) for TlSbTe\\({}_{2}\\), TlSbSe\\({}_{2}\\), TlSbS\\({}_{2}\\).\n\nHence these compounds are topologically nontrivial quantum spin Hall systems.\n\nIn the case of TlBiTe\\({}_{2}\\), the upper and lower Dirac cones are almost degenerate at \\(\\tilde{\\Gamma}\\).\n\nFigure 3 (color online).\n\nPanels (A)–(C) show the bulk band structure of TlSbTe\\({}_{2}\\) for \\(z_{\\rm Te}=0\\), 0.21, and 0.33 Å, respectively.The fcc notation for the high-symmetry points is used as in Fig.\n\n1(b).\n\nPanels (D) and (E) show the direct gaps at \\(\\Gamma\\) (blue solid line) and \\(X\\) (red dashed line) as a function of \\(V_{a}\\) and \\(z_{\\rm Te}\\), respectively.\n\nThe gray area highlights features related to topological nontriviality.\n\nPanel (F) shows the surface state dispersions at an optimized value of \\(z_{\\rm Te}\\) [red (gray) lines].\n\nProjected bulk bands are shown as blue areas.Projected bulk bands are shown as blue areas.\n\nInterestingly, AgBiTe\\({}_{2}\\), AgBiSe\\({}_{2}\\), and AgInSe\\({}_{2}\\) all possess a crystal structure similar to the present compounds, but with \\(M=\\) Ag.\n\nHowever, our first-principles bulk and surface state computations on these Ag compounds indicate a lack of band inversions.In particular, the surface and bulk bands display similar dispersions, and there is no evidence for the presence of a protected Dirac-cone surface band or other signatures of topologically interesting behavior.\n\nApart from the fact that Tl compounds are usually semi-metallic or very weakly semiconducting, they are topologically similar to the Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) series discovered previously.Recently, it was found that upon Cu doping, Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) comes a superconductor with a \\(T_{c}=3.8\\) K and exhibits unconventional band topology .\n\nThe doped topological states in the Tl-based compounds thus are also a likely candidate for finding odd-parity topological superconductors similar to the Cu\\({}_{x}\\)Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) series .In conclusion, we have shown that the Tl-based III-V-VI\\({}_{2}\\) ternary chalcogenides are highly favorable for supporting \\(Z_{2}=-1\\) topological states.\n\nTheir topological nature is driven by the band inversions at _both_\\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(X\\) points.\n\nWe identify the optimal surface termination for single-Dirac-cone surface states and predict that thin films could harbor 2D topologically nontrivial quantum spin Hall states.Our study thus indicates that the present Tl-based compounds constitute a fertile ground for observing and engineering topologically interesting phases of quantum matter.\n\nWe acknowledge discussions with R. J. Cava and B. Barbiellini.",
