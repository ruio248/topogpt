How does the bound on σ² change when a << 1/πT, and what factors affect its value in this regime?\n3. Why might increasing τ be beneficial for implementing phase gates, despite the risk of decoherence?\n4. In the context of computing π/8-phase gates, how does changing γ impact the required parameters for successful implementation?\n5. For an Ising-type system with chargeless Ising edges, what are the specific values of gc, gn, e, and α that apply?\n6. How does the proposed phase gate implementation alleviate concerns related to controlling bulk quasiparticle motion during computations?\n7. What advantage does this approach offer compared to traditional methods for manipulating edge states?\n8. Can you explain why the authors propose using established techniques for edge deformation via top and side gates in their method?\n9. What limitations or challenges arise from requiring both short τ and small errors in the phase gate operation?\n10. How does the value of θ relate to the frequency ω in determining the optimal conditions for phase gate implementation?",
