        "text": "(See text for details.)\n\noccurs.\n\nThe path connecting the two points crosses the phase boundary at a critical point \\(\\lambda=\\lambda^{}\\), where an \"interplateau transition\" takes place as depicted in Fig.\n\n3(a) in thick solid (dashed) lines.\n\nThe field strength for the transition around the value of \\(\\lambda^{}\\sim\\mathcal{O}(0.1)\\) is estimated to be of the order of \\(\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{6})\\) [V/cm].This is to be compared, e.g., with the corresponding estimate of \\(\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{7})\\) [V/cm] made in relation to dynamic localization, a prototypical example of optical manipulation of electron dynamics.\n\nThe above parallelism loosely conforms with earlier work (_not_ straightforwardly applicable to our adiabatic process) suggesting that a circularly polarized light should affect electron motion in an manner analogous to a magnetic field .Let us now size up what the implications of our strategy are for various physically motivated systems.\n\n(i) It has been shown that the distribution of the Aharanov-Bohm-like flux inherent in the Haldane model (described by the phase \\(\\phi\\)) can be mimicked by tight-binding electrons on a kagome lattice moving in the background of a spin chirality ordering.\n\nThis idea has led to a detailed analysis on the anomalous Hall effect in several pyrochlore ferromagnets, such as Nd\\({}_{2}\\)Mn\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{7}\\).Our method readily carries over to this system; indeed, in the notation of Ref.\n\nwe find that applying a circular polarized light to this particular model yields \\(\\mathcal{C}=-\\mathrm{sgn}[J_{0}(\\lambda)\\sin\\phi]\\) as the counterpart to Eq.\n\n(7), from which we expect to encounter the photo-induced transition \\(\\mathcal{C}=-1\\to\\mathcal{C}=+1\\) as a function of laser intensity.\n\n(ii) It has also been proposed that the Haldane model can be simulated by a fermionic cold atom on an optical lattice .A simple estimation reveals that the energy scale of the laser fields which constitute the lattice (\\(\\sim\\)1 [eV]) and that of the additional sweeping field (\\(\\sim\\)10\\({}^{-10}\\) [eV] or larger) are easily separated, which makes the implementation of the adiabatic scheme feasible.\n\n(iii) The canonical Kane-Mele model for the QSHE, in the absence of a Rashba term, reduces to two copies (up-spin and down-spin) of Haldane models.(The Luttinger model for light or heavy hole bands in a semiconductor also reduces to the same model, provided we replace spins by a conserved pseudospin quantum number .)\n\nThe sum of the Chern numbers \\(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{I}}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{I}}\\) for each spin component cancels in accord with time-reversal symmetry, while the difference \\(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{I}}-\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{I}}\\) needs not.The preceding generalizes trivially to this situation, which now leads to a photoinduced normal to quantum spin Hall insulator transition.\n\nWhen the Rashba coupling is present, the \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{2}\\) invariant which takes over the role of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) can be evaluated following Ref.\n\n, by using a matrix-valued generalization of the Berry connection.\n\nHere again we find that the system can be laser tuned through a normal to quantum spin Hall insulator transition.Details on work along this line will be reported elsewhere.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated how a photoinduced normal-Chern transition occurs in the Haldane model.\n\nThe coupling to a driving laser field with circular polarization turns the transfer integrals into tunable variables, which can result in a change in the Chern number.\n\nThe strategy is reasonably general and suggests an optics-based scheme for manipulating the intrinsic topology of insulators.\n\nWe thank M.
