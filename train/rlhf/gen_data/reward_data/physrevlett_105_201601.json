        "answer_1": "Here are some instruction questions generated from the text:\n\n1. What is the cornerstone of physics that has been considered exact for over a century?\n2. In what way could Lorentz symmetry potentially be broken according to the theory discussed?\n3. According to the authors, what makes the idea of breaking Lorentz symmetry exciting for detecting new physics beyond the Standard Model?\n4. Which types of fields play a role in the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry in the mentioned theory? \n5. Can you explain why it's necessary to break Lorentz symmetry if we want to detect new physics beyond the Standard Model?\n6. In which areas of physics have researchers searched for evidence of approximately broken Lorentz symmetry?\n7. How does spontaneous symmetry-breaking relate to Lorentz symmetry being broken in the given context?\n8. Does the theory predict any particular observable consequences due to the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry?\n9. Are all four PACS numbers provided equally relevant to the topic at hand, or is one more prominent than others?\n10. Would the potential discovery of Lorentz symmetry breaking require significant changes to our understanding of fundamental physical laws?\n\nFeel free to modify them further if needed!",
        "answer_2": "Here are some instructional questions based on the provided text:\n\n1. What is Lorentz symmetry?\n2. Why is the breaking of Lorentz symmetry considered an interesting phenomenon in modern particle physics?\n3. Can you explain what it means for a symmetry to be \"spontaneously\" broken?\n4. In which area of the electromagnetic spectrum might one expect to find evidence for spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking if it occurs in nature?\n5. How does the presence of a rank-2 antisymmetric tensor field contribute to the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry?\n6. Which areas of research have already focused on searching for signs of Lorentz symmetry violation in experimentally detectable phenomena?\n7. Are there any examples of theoretical frameworks that predict the existence of topsologically defects arising from Lorentz symmetric-breaking mechanisms?\n8. What potential implications would the discovery of observations consistent with Lorentz symmetry breaking have for our understanding of fundamental physical laws?\n\nLet me know if these questions meet your requirements!",
